| Semester:      | FS24                                     |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------- |
| **Data:**      | Daily trajectories  |
| **Title:**     | Transit detection of daily mobility patterns |
| **Student 1:** | Tanja Falasca                       |

## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) -->
1. Which detection methods can identify transit modes accurately?
2. 
## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->
1. Movement data (trajectories) from the data pool
2. POI from Open Street Map (OSM)
3. 
## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->


## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
