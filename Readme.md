## Abstract 
In this work, we are going to examine biking GPS data. The focus of this project is to examine speed and route deviations considering the environment and time in which the tracking was conducted. The analysis will be conducted in the R environment. Depending on the results, we will try to identify possible reasons behind them. 

## Research Questions
1.	Are there any speed deviations, and if so, what are they and why do they occur? (Consider different speeds on various trips or fluctuations during a single trip, and explore the potential reasons)
   
2.	Are there any differences in the routes preferred at different times of the day or in different directions (e.g. outbound and return trips)?

## Results / products
We expect speed deviations. Possible reason may be the traffic conditions (e.g. traffic lights or increased traffic in rush hours). We also expect differences between the outbound and return trips as well as deviations between routs taken in the different times of the day.

## Data
We are going to work with trajectory data and then use the biking data from it. The data was collected with the Strava app mainly in Karlsruhe, Germany. The additional data we are going to use is the OpenStreetMap of the Karlsruhe city, which will be taken from an open internet resource. During the work on the project, we might consider using some other open data.
